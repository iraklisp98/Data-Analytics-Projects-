The purpose of this project was to carry out descriptive, comparative and time analysis of three major European Footbal Leagues
(Premier League, League 1, La Liga) in three consequtive seasons. The analysis was performed around three statistics (goals, corners,
Shots on Goal). A brief analysis regarding the performance of each team was also carried out during this period. Patterns, trends, correlations
between statistics were found in order to have a better insight on the overall strategy in each League. Distribution fitting was also carried out
in order to determine which distributions and why better describe our data
